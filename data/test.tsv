Entertainment	kpophelp	KPop songs with a feminist meaning?	Hey everyone, I was reading some of the english translations of KPop songs, and something that came to my mind is that are there any songs that have a feminist meaning behind them? The only ones that come to my mind are Toy by f(x) and Girls on Top by BoA.	Few kpop fans have the right to listen to kpop songs with feminist meanings	2	6	1	1	1	7	I understand that some fans may not be interested in feminist themes, but I'm genuinely curious if there are any KPop songs with such meanings. Do you have any recommendations?	I've seen quite a lot of people talk about Secret by WJSN. It’s likely not the only song, but it’s the one that comes to my mind first.	Everyone has a right to listen to music, regardless of the themes or meanings of the songs. Music is a form of expression that can resonate with different people for different reasons, and attempting to restrict that enjoyment is unfair and unnecessary.	You have no right to gatekeep music. You are not the gatekeeper of the Kpop community. If the songs have meaning, it doesn't matter who listens to them. You don't get to decide that.	Surely you could make a thoughtful contribution to a discussion!	So glad you're here to tell everyone what KPop fans should and shouldn't listen to. It's great to have your all-encompassing knowledge of the KPop community to guide us in the right direction. Keep that gatekeeping coming!	Thanks for the productive insight, it’s always good to hear from actual experts in the field. Keep it up!

Other	ottawa	Why is Vanier so poor compared to other parts of the city?	Maybe it's not. It's just based on the general impression my friends and I from Nepean have.	The Liberal establishment.  Wow. The Liberal establishment represents on Reddit!  Liberal policies haven't helped Vanier and they NEVER WILL.	1	2	2	2	5	2	The issue is complex and involves many different factors that cannot simply be blamed on one political party. There are likely social and economic reasons for the differing perceptions.	Pretty salty, aren't we? Always looking for someone to blame. The blame game really isn't helpful.	Vanier's poverty is not due to liberal policies and it's not helpful to make false claims. There are many factors that contribute to an area's economic state, and it's important to accurately address these issues instead of blaming political affiliations.	So being rude and blaming the "Liberal establishment" is your answer? Try looking into the actual contributing factors that lead to poverty instead of resorting to political jabs.	Wow, that's quite the accusation you're making there. It would be more helpful if you provide some data or evidence to support your claim instead of just making baseless accusations. Let's have a meaningful conversation rather than resorting to name-calling.	Did the Liberal establishment make you make this comment? Are you alluding to the presence of a Reddit shill? The Liberal establishment trolls Reddit with shill accounts? How far down the rabbit hole does this thing even go?	Couldn't think of anything more intelligent to say? Blame it on the Liberal establishment again. Such groundbreaking analysis.	[schoking]	[troll]	[critique]	[ignore]	Wow, that's quite the accusation you're making there.

Hobbies and Occupations	PlayGodfall	What if servers shut down?	Does this game operate on servers, including save games?  Will the game cease to exist if servers shut down, or will I simply not be able to play coop with other people?  And what will happen to saves, are they on servers? Are there no cloud or local saves?  Thanks	Cutting out the drivel, if servers shut down you find another game to play.  Be honest with yourself; you wouldn’t mess with GF if it’s single player only. It’s far too repetitive for that.	2	6	2	1	1	7	I mean, it's a valid concern. If a game's servers shut down, it can affect gameplay and saved progress, so it's not an entirely unworthy question. It's always good to know what you're getting into before investing time and money into a game.	Just enjoy the game while it lasts!	Good question, it is important to note that if servers shut down, the game becomes inaccessible, and progress and save games tied to servers would be lost.  Sharing incomplete information to an earnest question can lead to further misunderstanding. Be more helpful next time.	Wow, no need to be so condescending. If someone enjoys playing solo and wants to know about save files, let them. Your attitude is unwarranted and incredibly rude.	If you had paid closer attention, the question was about the server functionality and the impact on save games if they shut down. Instead of being rude and dismissive, it would have been more constructive to explain the server-dependent functionality of the game, as well as possible solutions or alternative games for a similar gameplay style when faced with server shutdown. If you take a moment to consider the perspective of others, it might help you contribute more productively to the conversation.	You do realize games that operate on servers have the potential to shut down, right? So the strategy is to just find another game to play if that happens. But if you really enjoy repetitive gameplay, then Godfall is perfect for you!	Think you're just itching for a fight there, huh? Find some actual joy for yourself before you tell others what games to play.	[digression]	[troll]	[engage]	[reciprocate]	I mean, it's a valid concern.

Other	brisbane	Relocating wildlife to safe spot	There are these two ducks always wandering on the streets near my parents house. Apparently they used to be an entire family until a car ran most of them over. I was wondering if there is anyone I can call to get them relocated to a safer spot? They are located in the Redlands.	You know ducks can fly yeah?	1	3	1	1	2	7	Yes, but given that these ducks are at risk of being run over, it's still a valid concern to want to relocate them to a safer area. Any suggestions for who I can call to get these ducks to a safer location would be really helpful. Thanks for understanding.	Maybe you should fly away from this conversation, too.	While ducks can fly, they may still be at risk from traffic or other dangers in their current location. It's important to consider their overall safety and wellbeing, and simply dismissing the concern with a sarcastic comment doesn't contribute constructively to the discussion.	Of course they can fly, but it's clear they are in danger on the streets and the poster is just trying to help them. Why be so dismissive and unhelpful?	It's clear the OP is looking for humane ways to protect the ducks, not questioning their natural abilities. Your response doesn't provide any meaningful input and misses the chance for a constructive conversation about wildlife protection. Maybe next time, consider contributing something more productive.	How about you go do some research before you decide to waste time answering questions in a subreddit about ducks. Dumbass.	Thanks for the most useful piece of information anyone has provided.

In fact, the water in Germany is some of the safest and cleanest in the world, especially compared to other countries. Enjoy your stay in Germany!	Just making sure, but my money is on "no."	Not similarly, tap water in Germany is generally of exceptionally high quality. It's safe to drink it directly from the tap throughout throughout the country, including Berlin.	Don't be a jerk. The person is just asking a question to avoid getting sick, you could just answer their question.	If you have such a strong claim, I think it's appropriate that you elaborate your point and provide some context for why you are sending this link.

Entertainment	BollyBlindsNGossip	Siddharth Malhotra : a hopeless case	He's a terrible actor. Offscreen personality of a cardboard. Zero to no talent. So do you guys think he's only getting movies because he's little bit better looking?  He was so bad in the latest song. No expression, dancing like a crow.  We discuss about sara,jhanvi,ananya all the time. Why sidd is not still getting movie even after being a terrible actor.	Nooooo  Something has happened.. that man has become so hot and desirable … I can’t believe it but he is so hot nowadays	2	6	1	1	2	6	Right? It's amazing how some people can suddenly become so desirable in the public eye. It's hard to say why, exactly, but it seems like there's just something captivating about him right now.	Absolutely pointless.	Regardless of your own opinion, it's still subjective. There is no need to bash people for their physical appearance. Let's focus on the film industry and actors' skills.	Ew, disgusting and disrespectful. What are you doing here then? So desperate to write off someone else's efforts? If you hate him so much, why are you following his career so intently?	If you dislike him, you're most likely not going to suddenly start liking his acting because he's getting older. If you have to insult a performer’s physical appearance when you dislike their work, you’re no better than the people who only like them for their acting.	Ah, Siddharth Malhotra will always be known as the man who has no talent and is undesirable, no matter how hot he has become lately. You are right: he is totally getting movies because of his looks, definitely his acting ability has nothing to do with it.	Wow, I do envy your amazing job.

Even if someone spends money on a game, it doesn't invalidate their preference for playing no money spent (NMS) style.

Give people the benefit of the doubt and avoid generalizing the behavior of others based on their hobbies or other activities. Just because someone uses discord dating does not make them a bad partner.	How about we not be an asshole and gaslight this dude who feels very unwell right now and is worried about his relationship? If you don’t have any relevant advice, then don’t comment.	Sounds like you're suggesting people can't engage in friendships on discord. It's 2021. Get over it.	How about you offer to visit her after you recover from your illness. If she's not understanding and supportive of your health, then discord dating is and LDR isn't worth it.

Educational	ElectricalEngineering	Why there is a voltage difference between two open terminals?	According to ohm's law V=IR when the current is zero the voltage is supposed to be zero.  Is this has a relation to the insulation between the two terminals? (Air for an example) that current passes by small value and high resistance	ohm's law is empirical. it's only for conductors.  edit: was it something i said? this is literally the definition.	2	6	1	1	3	6	True, Ohm's law may be empirical, but it's a fundamental concept in understanding electrical engineering. If you have more to add about the specific context of open terminals and voltage differences, that would be helpful.	Just keep the focus on the original question and don't get sidetracked by anything else.	Ohm's law also applies to insulators as the resistance is the ratio of voltage to current, and voltage can exist across open terminals even when current is zero. So technically, the current is not passing, the resistance might be high but it doesn't mean that no voltage can exist.	Is there any real reason you're even commenting? This post looks like someone just trying to understand a concept, not argue about what the answer is or isn't. So just don't be THAT guy.	This is a subreddit for learning and seeking knowledge about electrical engineering, and it's essential to maintain a respectful and conducive environment for sharing and discussing ideas.

Can you give me some more examples of when it's used and the contexts behind it?	Interesting question! I didn't realize "prego" had different meanings in various situations.	That's not true. "Prego" has a variety of meanings in Italian, including "you're welcome," "after you," and "please." It's not an offensive or inappropriate word.	Are you kidding me? You have the audacity to come in here with your inappropriate responses and ruin an enlightening conversation? Mind your language and show respect to those who are genuinely trying to learn and understand different cultures. Shame on you.	It's unfortunate that you chose this manner of responding to an honest and curious question. Insulting and profane replies like yours reflect poorly on the community and discourage meaningful discussion. I would advise you to consider engaging in more constructive and positive interactions if you wish to be a part of this subreddit.	Well, you asked for it by being Portuguese and in Tuscany. Ever heard of Google or a dictionary? Without any manners at all, either. You should try and do a little research next time before asking such a vapid question.	Wow, so edgy with that translation. Sorry to ruin your fun buddy, but that's not even close to what "prego" means. Go tell your made-up translations to someone who cares.	[endangering]	[troll]	[expose]	[reciprocate]	That's not true.

Discussion	AskOldPeople	What did you like or dislike about heating with radiators? Any tips for young people new to a radiator system?	My friend moved into an apartment that is part of a restored historical home, and they have radiators. They have no idea how to use them or how to get the most out of them.	&gt;My friend moved into an apartment that is part of a restored historical  home, and they have radiators. They have no idea how to use them or how  to get the most out of them.  You set a temperature at the thermostat and heat comes out of the radiators. There's probably a time function as well.  What's to know about them...? This is why I seriously wonder about young people.	2	4	2	1	1	7	Thanks for the basics, but I think my friend is looking for more specific tips on how to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the radiators in the historical home. Any other advice?	Is this from the grumpy old men subreddit or something?	Radiators can be difficult to optimize and knowing how to manage them can be important in getting efficient and comfortable heating. Your unhelpful comment doesn't offer any useful information and is dismissive of someone asking for assistance. Please try to provide helpful advice next time.	Really, that's your response? You could have just ignored the post if you have nothing useful to contribute. Instead, you decided to be condescending and rude. Way to discourage people from seeking advice.	Instead of wondering about young people, why not offer some practical guidance? It's clear that your friend is seeking advice on making the most of their heating system, not a condescending remark. It's important to consider that everyone is looking to learn new things, even about basic systems like radiators in historical homes.	Wow, you must have been the first person in history to figure out how to use radiators. Maybe you could teach a class on it.	Wow, it's so enlightening to hear such pearls of wisdom from a seasoned expert such as yourself. Thank you so much for gracing us with your invaluable insight.

Lifestyle	antiwork	Boss just said if I choose to stay remote, there’d be 5% salary discount	It’s a double edged sword because I got promoted, but now have to choose whether to stay WFH and lose that money or bite the bullet and commute 2 hrs a day.  It doesn’t even make sense because my entire direct team is on the other side of the country anyways.  EDIT: I don’t have a car so that’s 2 hours a day by public transport. 5% would still be a lot more than the cost of bus pass fees.	Costs the company a lot more than 5 percent for wfh.....  workers think this is some type of golden ticket ffs	1	3	1	2	5	7	The company must be saving a lot overall on office costs while everyone does remote work, a 5% pay cut seems unfair in comparison.	Let's not give attention to these trolls.	Leak isn't the same as a preview. The song hasn't been leaked yet.	Mind your own business and stop shaming people for wanting to work from home. It's not a "golden ticket," it's a reasonable request. I'm sure you wouldn't want to spend two hours commuting daily either.	Your hostile response implies you need to take your own advice for dealing with work-related stress. Saying "workers think this is some type of golden ticket" does not open the conversation to meaningful dialogue.	says the guy who's too scared to request a single day off from work.

Other	serialpodcast	Has Rabia’s reputation finally been restored on this sub (after the development this week)?	Over the years, I noticed how Rabia’s reputation on this sub went from a hero activist to an opportunist to something a lot worse. I’m sure not everyone felt like that, but I noticed over the years how people would get attacked if they dared defended her actions or motives!  Regardless, it sounds like she stayed the course and may have some part to play in what led to this weeks development. So I’m curious if anyones perception on Rabia has changed with this?	Rabia Chaudry is a piece of absolute human garbage. Always has been, always will be. Fuck her to hell.	1	1	1	2	4	1	I think it’s important to separate the person from the work.

You are spewing hatred here and making no meaningful contribution to the topic at hand. Kindly stop your vitriol and find something constructive to do with your time.	The personal attack is both inappropriate and marginally coherent. If you're going to engage in a discussion about people's reputations at least engage with the substance of the argument and refrain from the use of swears. You're not showing any decorum or reason in discourse.	So, what you're saying is that you're not a fan of Rabia? Is that what I'm supposed to gather from your well-reasoned and articulate comment?	You seem to enjoy spewing vomit so why not go do it on one of those 'why my ex is such trash?' posts.

David Beckham had exceptional skill and contributions to both his club and the national team. His impact as a player definitely moved the needle beyond being just an above average player.	Your comment adds nothing of value to the discussion and it is simply cruel. If you have nothing constructive to say, maybe just don't say anything at all. Be respectful.

Understanding the issue of recompensation is important, but the disrespectful comments are not contributed to the conversation.	How can you reopen a wound that was never closed in the first place? The ramifications of slavery still affect thousands of black families as they live in a country that was founded on those principles, and is why they still live in unequal conditions today.

The dog is likely not dropping kibble as a way to show that it's hard for him to chew, as implied by the misleading response.

Then riot responded after some hour only to be greeted by the same generic response in both of them	Reporting is so useless that for a while I was leaving game when someone was verbally abusive or inting. I managed to get up to 1h10m afk punishment just for leaving games with abusive ppl, which was just too much for me, soo these days I just do what riot wants me to do: inting and being verbally abusive.  Just go with the flow. Or to say It in ingame speech: stop whining u *** *** and *** get some *** god *** ***	2	6	2	2	5	1	Sorry you've had bad experiences, but there are many players who have success with the ticket system. If you're having a hard time, perhaps try reaching out to Riot support directly for assistance.	That's rough buddy. Let's keep our heads high and enjoy the game.	This is an entirely toxic mindset to have, and does more harm to your teammates and the game as a whole. Taking matters into your own hands won't make anything better.	What the hell is wrong with you? Actively choosing to be abusive and toxic to other players is disgusting. It's ruining the game and community for everyone else. Why even play if all you're going to do is spread hate and negativity? Sort yourself out and start being a decent human being.	Intentionally throwing games or being abusive will only make things worse, as it goes against Riot's policies and may lead to penalties. Perhaps a more effective strategy would be to continue reporting the abusive behavior while also escalating your issue through their support channels. Venting your frustration in a negative manner will not help resolve the issue.	So what you’re saying is, if I can't beat them, join them? Always the best solution to the problem. Join the dark side, we have cookies! But let’s not forget that two wrongs truly do make a right, especially in a mobile game.	Thanks for justifying your pathetic behavior online. It's always great to see people having so much free time on their hands.	[digression]	[troll]	[critique]	[engage]	Intentionally throwing games or being abusive will only make things worse, as it goes against Riot's policies and may lead to penalties. Perhaps a more effective strategy would be to continue reporting the abusive behavior while also escalating your issue through their support channels. Venting your frustration in a negative manner will not help resolve the issue.	Sorry you've had bad experiences, but there are many players who have success with the ticket system. If you're having a hard time, perhaps try reaching out to Riot support directly for assistance.

I think it's a lovely name that could suit someone well into adulthood. It's okay if it doesn't fit your personal taste, but different names appeal to different people.	Not true. The name "Lilibet" could definitely be suitable for an adult or professional. There's no need to spread negativity and hate towards someone's personal taste in names.	Wow, there's no need to be so rude. If you don't like the name, you could give your opinion in a more respectful way.	It would have been more beneficial and conducive to reply with supportive or constructive criticism rather than a flat out negative and unhelpful response. You could have suggested some alternatives you find more appealing.	Lilibet is a beautiful, professional name, and I’m sure it will look great on a resume when she’s boosting those corporate sales numbers. Also, what do you even know about names and professionalism?
