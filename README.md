# ELF-HP: Human Preference-Aligned Counter Trolling Dataset

## Overview

ELF-HP is a dataset designed for studying human-preferred counter-response strategies in Reddit discussions. The dataset contains annotated posts and comments from various subreddits, including various type of trolling attempts and multiple response strategies. You can read our paper ["Towards Effective Counter-Responses: Aligning Human Preferences with Strategies to Combat Online Trolling"](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.683.pdf) published in the Findings of EMNLP 2024.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is located in the data directory and consists of three files:

`train.tsv`: 875 labeled instances (with Trolling Strategy and Response Strategy annotations)

`test.tsv`: 50 labeled instances (with Trolling Strategy and Response Strategy annotations)

`total.tsv`: a total of 1,189 instances, including non-troll examples

## Fields

Each row in the dataset contains the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|

| `TrollingCategory` | int | 1: Overt troll, 2: Covert troll |
| `TrollingStrategy` | int | 0: Non-troll, 1-6: Trolling strategies (refer to paper for details) |
| `TSReason` | int | The reason for the trolling strategy label (refer to Table 3 in our paper) |
| `ResponseCategory` | int | 1: Nudging, 2: Confrontational |
| `MostPreferredRS` | int | The most preferred response strategy |
| `LeastPreferredRS` | int | The least preferred response strategy |
| `RS1` to `RS7` | str | The model-generated response for each response strategy |
| `FlagTS` | str | Flag for trolling strategy |
| `FlagTroll` | str | Flag for troll identification |
| `ChosenFlagRS` | str | Chosen flag for response strategy |
| `RejectFlagRS` | str | Rejected flag for response strategy |
